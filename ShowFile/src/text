I don't care what you say
You can give it away
Your money don't mean much to me.
I've been out on my own
Gonna got it alone now
'Cause that's the way it's got to be.
Ev'rybody tells me how I can beat the odds for now.
Well
I've been standing by the fire
But I iust can't feel the heat.
Heartbeat - I'm looking for a heartbeat
Heartbeat - I'm looking for a heartbeat
Beating like mine.
Looking at me
It's easy to see
You think you know iust how I feel.
If you do to me wrong and it won't take me long
Before my restless heart will heal.
I'm looking for a love
Love like mine
They tell me it's so hard to find
But I can feel it in the rhythm of the heartbeat in the street.
Heartbeat - I'm looking for a heartbeat
Heartbeat - I'm looking for a heartbeat
Beating like mine
Beating like mine.
Tell me what you feel now without the heartbeat
Tell me is it real now without the heartbeat?
Heartbeat - I'm looking for a heartbeat.
