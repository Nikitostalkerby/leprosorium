I don't need your forgiveness
I don't need your hate
I don't need your acceptance
So what should I do?

I don't need your resistance
I don't need your prayers
I don't need no religion
away from you

I don't do what I've been told
You're so lame why don't you just go

Die mother fucker, die mother fucker, die
Die mother fucker, die mother fucker, die
Die mother fucker, die mother fucker, die
Die mother fucker, die mother fucker, die

I don't need your prison
I don't need your pain
I don't need your decision
So what should I do?

I don't need your approval
I don't need your hope
I don't need your religion
I don't need a thing from you

I'll be sorry when I'm old
You're so full of shit man just go

Die mother fucker, die mother fucker, die
Die mother fucker, die mother fucker, die
Die mother fucker, die mother fucker, die
Die mother fucker, die mother fucker, die

I don't need your forgiveness
I don't need your hate
I don't need your acceptance
So what should I do?

I'll be sorry so you said
I'm not sorry BANG you're dead

Die mother fucker, die mother fucker, die
Die mother fucker, die mother fucker, die
Die mother fucker, die mother fucker, die
Die mother fucker, die mother fucker, die

Die
Die
Die
Die
