In this life I'm me,
Just sitting here alone
and by the way I tried to say I'd be there
For you

Walk beside an emptiness
That leads me by my hands
And throw away
What I don't understand, as a man

Love-Hate-Sex-Pain
It's complicating me sometimes
This love-Hate-Sex-Pain
Is underestimating life

And I wonder as I tear away my skin
It's taken me so long to stitch
These wounds from where I've been
And mother please don't bury me
I'm hanging for my life
It's hard to say that I would be complete
Before I die

Love-Hate-Sex-Pain
It's complicating me sometimes
This love-Hate-Sex-Pain
Is underestimating life

Don't you worry please
Don't you leave me

Because I slowly slip away
Through love, hate, sex, and pain
I fall away into
Love, hate sex, and pain

Love-Hate-Sex-Pain
It's complicating me sometimes
This love-Hate-Sex-Pain
Is underestimating life

Love-Hate-Sex-Pain
It's complicating me sometimes
This love-Hate-Sex-Pain
Is underestimating life
