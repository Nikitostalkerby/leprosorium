Deep down in Louisiana close the New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B Good
Who never ever learned to read or write so well
But he could play the guitar just like ringin a bell

Go, go, go Jonny go go
Go Johnny go go
Go Johnny go go
Go Johnny go go
Johnny be good

He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Or sit beneath the tree by the railroad track
Oh an engineer could see him sitting in the shade
Strummin' to the rhythm that the drivers made
People passing by they'd stop and say
Oh my but that little country boy can play

Go, go, go Jonny go go
Go Johnny go go
Go Johnny go go
Go Johnny go go
Johnny be good

His mother told him some day you will be a man
And you will be the leader of a big old band
Many people coming from miles around
And hear you play your music till the sun goes down
Maybe someday your name gonna be in light
Sayin' Jonny be good tonight

Go, go, go Jonny go go
Go Johnny go go
Go Johnny go go
Go Johnny go go
Johnny be good
